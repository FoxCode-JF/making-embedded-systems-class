# Make Blinky !
The goal is to make a evaluation board blink its led.

## Board used
My board of choice is **_STM32F411E-DISCO_**

## Build and programming environment 
I used **_STM32CubeMxIDE_** to generate and write code. I took advantage of STM32F4xx_HAL_Driver to speed up coding process.

## Implementation
